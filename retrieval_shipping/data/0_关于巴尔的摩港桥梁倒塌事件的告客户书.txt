Dear Valued Customer, 



We hereby notify you that, based on the information currently accessible to us, the Port of Baltimore will be indefinitely closed following the collision of the 948-foot container vessel 'DALI' with the Francis Scott Key Bridge on March 26th.

Based on the circumstances mentioned above, we will declare force majeure in accordance with Clause 20 of our Bill of Lading Terms and Conditions, and we wish to communicate our contingency plan regarding shipments to/from Baltimore as outlined below, until further notice:

1. For Shipments from Baltimore:

 Shipments currently at the terminal will remain there till the port reopens, unless otherwise directed by the shipper.
 For shipments in transit: Given the temporary suspension of export operations at the terminal, please liaise with COSCO SHIPPING North America customer service for alternative port of loading options.
 We regret to inform you that no new export bookings will be accepted from Baltimore until further notice.




2. For Shipments to Baltimore:

 Shipments currently in transit will be redirected to an alternate port, where they will be made available for pick-up, and COSCO SHIPPING's bill of lading will be concluded.
 For booked cargoes not yet loaded at the origin, please coordinate with the origin booking party.



We extend our sincere appreciation for your ongoing trust and support during this challenging time. Should you have any questions or require additional assistance, please do not hesitate to reach out to your local sales representatives.

Warm regards,
COSCO SHIPPING Lines
