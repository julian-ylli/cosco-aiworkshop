Since the conflict broke out in Israel on October 7, 2023, the global team of COSCO SHIPPING Lines has been maintaining a high level of attention and vigilance.

Currently, the two main ports, Ashdod and Haifa, in Israel continue to operate. However, due to increased security checks and labor shortages, Ashdod is experiencing congestion, resulting in increased waiting time. Please be advised that inland services may experience delays, including roads and railways.

Additionally, according to the latest regulations of the authorities, the acceptance of dangerous goods in Ashdod&Haifa has been suspended. Despite these measures, COSCO SHIPPING Lines will continue to accept bookings for Israeli import-export transportation and maintain normal operations in the region.

We will continue to closely monitor the situation and update you on the latest operational information.

If you have any questions or need further information, our customer service team is always available to assist you.
